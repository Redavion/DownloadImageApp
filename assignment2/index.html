  <h3>Generic Array (Assignment 2) Due Friday, October 2 at Midnight</h3>

  <h4>Overview of the Generic Array Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Eclipse to develop a generic Java Array class.  An Array is an
    abstract data type (ADT) with operations such as get(), set(),
    size(), and iterator(). Your task is to implement a generic Array
    ADT in Java.  This array will be different from Java built-in
    arrays since (1) it can be resized and (2) it works only on
    user-defined types.
  </p>
  <p>
    Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for graduate
    credit) must do the following additional work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implement the requirements of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Spliterator.html">SplitIterator</a> interface.

  </ul>

  <p>
    As much as possible, you should avoid using loops in this assignment.  In our solution, we only needed to use an explicit looping construct once.
  </p>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p>
    Skeleton code for this assignment is available
    in the class Bitbucket repository.  Once you've setup your <a href="https://bitbucket.com/">Bitbucket</a> account you can pull this
    skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and complete the
    "TODO" markers.
  </p>

  <p> Note that the unit tests for this assignment are still a
    work-in-progress, a revised test suite will be available shortly.

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  Like Assignment 1, this assignment is designed to be relatively easy to help
    you get familiar with programming Java.  If you find it extremely
    hard to complete this assignment you may not be ready to take this
    class.  If this is the case, please meet with the instructors ASAP
    to discuss.  </p>
